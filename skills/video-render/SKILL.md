name: video-render
description: Renders a checked composition to the delivery file - HyperFrames render at the platform's resolution and bitrate, BT.709 tags, audio master, structural verify; assembles long-form sections. Use when the user says "render", "export", "make the final", "4K", "assemble", or after notes for a new version.

# render

> **Styles:** Canvas sizes and safe zones: `video-take-geometry/references/canvas-safe-zones.md`.

Rendering is the slow, expensive step, so nothing reaches it unchecked, and nothing leaves it unverified.

```bash
ENG="${VIDEO_ENGINE:-$HOME/.agents/skills/video-pipeline/engine}"; S="$ENG/scripts"; W="videos/<project>"
```

## Before rendering

- `npx hyperframes check "$W/hyperframes"` passes and the snapshots were read (the `video-format` skill). A snapshot is seconds; a
  render is minutes.
- The user saw the snapshot sheet at gate 1 or approved a previous version with the same layout.
- Free disk: about 2 x minutes x 0.34 GB for 4K; HyperFrames' frame cache lives in the temp folder.

## One command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Virtual Environment (STRICT)**: ALWAYS run `render.py` using the project's virtual environment (`"$PROJECT/.venv/bin/python3"`). Never invoke system python.

```bash
"$PROJECT/.venv/bin/python3" "$S/render.py" --public "$W/hyperframes" --out "$W/processed/<project>-v<N>.mp4" \
  --resolution portrait --audio-preset shorts [--denoise auto|strong|neural|off] [--music "$W/music/bed.wav"] [--gpu]
```

It renders with HyperFrames, adds the BT.709 tags losslessly, masters the audio (`audio-chain.py`: loudness to the
preset, true-peak limit, adaptive/neural noise filtering, ducked music), and runs `verify-render.py` (resolution, tags, bitrate, duration against the
composition, A/V offset, black frames and one-frame flashes) into `$W/processed/<project>-v<N>-VERIFY.md`. Exit 1 means do not
deliver. `--raw FILE` finishes a render made elsewhere. `--denoise auto` (default) automatically applies adaptive multi-band
denoising (`afftdn` + `arnndn`) when background noise exceeds -50 dBFS; `--denoise neural` engages DeepFilterNet3 for car/road noise.

| Platform | `--resolution` | Bitrate | `--audio-preset` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shorts / Reels / TikTok | `portrait` (or `portrait-4k` from 4K sources) | 12M (45M at 4K) | `shorts` |
| YouTube long-form | `landscape-4k` | 45M | `youtube` |
| Podcast-style long talk | `landscape-4k` | 45M | `longform` |
| Square feed | `square` | 10M | `shorts` |

The composition stays at its authored size; HyperFrames renders at a higher device scale for 4K, so the aspect must
match the preset.

## Long renders

Over about 2 minutes, compose per section and join with `assemble.py` (one master, each section loudness-normalised,
chapters listed); over about 5 minutes of 4K, use segmented capture. The traps that cost renders (black footage under
parallel workers, frame-cache disk use, GPU ignoring CRF) are in `video-motion-graphics/references/kit-motion.md`. A note on a
long render costs a patch, not a re-render: `window-patch.py` renders only the changed window.

## After

Hand the file to `video-review-gate` before the user sees it. Versions keep counting (v2, v3); keep each version's VERIFY,
audio report and ledger. Never hand-edit a master; change the source and render again.
