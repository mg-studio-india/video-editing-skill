# Video Audio

Goal: clearer, natural speech approaching podcast quality. Preserve the source; never overwrite it. Process the assembled mix once for final loudness.

## 1. Inspect Tools and Source

Verify local tools:
```bash
set -eu
ENG="${VIDEO_ENGINE:-$HOME/.agents/skills/video-pipeline/engine}"
command -v ffmpeg
command -v ffprobe
command -v sox
ffmpeg -hide_banner -filters 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'afftdn|arnndn|loudnorm|alimiter|highpass|acompressor|deesser|equalizer' || true
INPUT="/path/to/input"
```

## 2. The Dynamic Identification Process (Input-Driven Calibration)

Never apply hardcoded frequencies, blind mic extraction, or static noise sample timestamps. Dialogue audio varies across devices, speakers, and acoustic spaces. 

Run the dynamic acoustic analysis on the input file before applying filters:

```bash
python3 "$ENG/scripts/audio-analyze.py" "$INPUT" --json > acoustic_profile.json
```

The analyzer inspects the raw signal and dynamically identifies:

| Acoustic Variable | Measurement Method | How It Derives Settings |
|---|---|---|
| **Channel Routing** (`CH_FILTER`) | Compares Channel 0 vs 1 RMS & speech band (300–3500 Hz) energy. | If asymmetric (e.g. phone with mouth mic vs room mic): selects dominant speech mic (`pan=mono\|c0=c0` or `pan=mono\|c0=c1`). If symmetric: downmixes `pan=mono\|c0=0.5*c0+0.5*c1`. If already mono: `anull`. |
| **Room-Tone Noise Window** (`NOISE_START`, `NOISE_DUR`) | 400ms sliding window scan across pauses to locate the quietest inter-phrase room tone floor (above digital silence). | Gives the exact timestamp to sample room hiss for SoX without clipping speech onsets or vocal tails. |
| **Voice Fundamental ($F_0$) & Highpass** (`HIGHPASS_HZ`) | Autocorrelation on voiced speech frames to detect the speaker's true pitch fundamental $F_0$. | Sets high-pass cutoff dynamically to $\max(75, F_0 - 25\text{ Hz})$ to kill sub-rumble without thinning male or female vocal fundamentals. |
| **Proximity Warmth** (`WARMTH_HZ`) | Centers warmth boost directly at detected $F_0$ ($100–150\text{ Hz}$ male, $180–240\text{ Hz}$ female). | Boosts the speaker's natural vocal chest resonance (+1.0 to +1.5 dB) rather than a blind arbitrary frequency. |
| **Room Standing Modes** (`NOTCH_FILTERS`) | High-resolution spectral scan across the $120–750\text{ Hz}$ room reverberation range to detect narrow stationary spikes ($\ge 2.8\text{ dB}$ above moving spectral envelope). | If standing modes exist: generates targeted surgical notches (`equalizer=f=$F:t=q:w=3.5:g=-$G`). If the acoustic space is clean: generates **no notches** to preserve phase integrity. |
| **Speech Level & Dynamics** (`COMP_THRESH`) | Measures 90th percentile voiced speech RMS. | Dynamically calibrates leveling compressor threshold to `speech_rms - 4 dB` to even out phrasing without over-squashing dynamics. |

## 3. The 2-Stage Dynamic Processing Pipeline

Once values are identified from the input, execute the 2-Stage Stacked Pipeline:

```
Raw Camera Audio
  │
  ▼ [Stage 1: Dynamic Clean Base]
Mic Selection (CH_FILTER) ──► Dynamic Highpass (HIGHPASS_HZ) ──► Measured Room Notches (NOTCH_FILTERS) ──► RNNoise (arnndn) ──► Dynamic SoX Noise Sample (NOISE_START)
  │
  ▼ [Stage 2: Calibrated Vocal Presence & Broadcast Master Stacked on Top]
Proximity Warmth (WARMTH_HZ) ──► Articulation & Presence (2.8k & 4.2k) ──► Studio Sheen (10k) ──► Calibrated Optical Leveling (COMP_THRESH, release 70ms) ──► 2-Pass Loudnorm (-14 LUFS)
```

### Stage 1: Extraction & Dynamic Baseline Denoising

```bash
# 1a. Extract primary speech channel, apply dynamic highpass and detected room notches
# (If no room resonances were detected, NOTCH_FILTERS is omitted)
ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -i "$INPUT" -vn \
  -af "${CH_FILTER},highpass=f=${HIGHPASS_HZ}:poles=2${NOTCH_FILTERS:+,${NOTCH_FILTERS}}" \
  -c:a pcm_s24le stage1_notched.wav

# 1b. Neural Speech Denoising & Reverb Suppression (RNNoise)
# Uses the sh.rnnn GRU model at ~/.config/video-skills/rnnoise/sh.rnnn
ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -i stage1_notched.wav \
  -af "arnndn=m='$HOME/.config/video-skills/rnnoise/sh.rnnn':mix=0.85" \
  -c:a pcm_s24le stage1_neural.wav

# 1c. Sample room noise from the dynamically identified quietest pause and apply gentle SoX reduction
sox stage1_neural.wav noise_sample.wav trim "${NOISE_START}" "${NOISE_DUR}"
sox noise_sample.wav -n noiseprof room.prof
sox stage1_neural.wav stage1_clean_base.wav noisered room.prof 0.15
```

### Stage 2: Calibrated Vocal Presence & Broadcast Leveling Stacked On Top

Run directly **on top of `stage1_clean_base.wav`** to add in-your-face creator presence, consonant articulation, chest warmth, and platform loudness:

```bash
# 2a. Pass 1: Measure loudnorm parameters with calibrated presence EQ and optical compression
ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -i stage1_clean_base.wav \
  -af "${NOTCH_FILTERS:+,${NOTCH_FILTERS},}equalizer=f=${WARMTH_HZ}:t=q:w=1.5:g=1.5,equalizer=f=2800:t=q:w=1.2:g=2.5,equalizer=f=4200:t=q:w=1.5:g=3.0,highshelf=f=10000:g=2.0,deesser=i=0.35:m=0.5:f=0.5,acompressor=threshold=${COMP_THRESH}dB:ratio=2.2:attack=15:release=70:knee=3:makeup=1,loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1.2:LRA=7:print_format=json" \
  -f null - 2>&1

# 2b. Pass 2: Render final 320k MP3 master using measured JSON values
ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -i stage1_clean_base.wav \
  -af "${NOTCH_FILTERS:+,${NOTCH_FILTERS},}equalizer=f=${WARMTH_HZ}:t=q:w=1.5:g=1.5,equalizer=f=2800:t=q:w=1.2:g=2.5,equalizer=f=4200:t=q:w=1.5:g=3.0,highshelf=f=10000:g=2.0,deesser=i=0.35:m=0.5:f=0.5,acompressor=threshold=${COMP_THRESH}dB:ratio=2.2:attack=15:release=70:knee=3:makeup=1,loudnorm=I=-14:TP=-1.2:LRA=7:measured_I=<input_i>:measured_TP=<input_tp>:measured_LRA=<input_lra>:measured_thresh=<input_thresh>:offset=<target_offset>:linear=true" \
  -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k mastered.mp3
```

## 4. Critical Engineering Rule: Preventing "Word Buzzing"

**Never apply aggressive fast-attack gates (`attack < 10ms`, `release < 80ms`) to dialogue.** 

Speech fundamentals ($F_0 \approx 100–250\text{ Hz}$) have acoustic wave periods of 4–10ms. When an amplitude gate opens and closes rapidly, it modulates the waveform within individual pitch cycles, producing a harsh buzz, edge flutter, or vowel sputtering at word boundaries. 

**Process rules:**
1. Rely on continuous frequency-domain neural masking (RNNoise `arnndn`) and SoX spectral subtraction (`noisered`) for noise/reverb decay suppression.
2. Use smooth, optical-style leveling (`attack=15-20ms`, `release=70-140ms`, `knee=3-4dB`) that maintains natural vowel decay and zero edge buzz.

## 5. Verification and Acceptance

Always verify the mastered MP3 with `ebur128` and Whisper transcription:

```bash
ffmpeg -hide_banner -i "mastered.mp3" -af "ebur128=peak=true" -f null -
whisper-cli -m ~/.cache/whisper.cpp/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin -f "mastered.mp3" --no-timestamps -l en
```

Must satisfy:
- Integrated Loudness: `-14.0 ± 0.5 LUFS`
- True Peak: `<= -1.0 dBTP`
- Zero word buzzing / gate chatter
- 100% speech transcription accuracy preserved with zero lost word endings
