# Plan & Storyboard (Pre-Cut Creative & Physics Architecture)

> **Styles:** Style catalog (all 225 styles, schema, owning file per style): `references/style-catalog.md` · storytelling styles #145-172 `references/styles-storytelling.md` · commercial & platform styles #201-225 `references/styles-commercial-platform.md` · duration & delivery `references/duration-delivery.md`.

Professional videos succeed or fail in the storyboard. **Storyboarding must happen BEFORE cutting raw footage or generating edits.** Cutting without a storyboard results in disjointed, mechanical clips that lack retention, context, and emotional pull.

Before writing a single beat of the storyboard, the creative dimensions must be resolved in **Gate 1** (`resolved-spec.json`) and speech verified in **Gate 2**. Never assume a generic video format or force a cookie-cutter template.

```bash
ENG="${VIDEO_ENGINE:-$HOME/.agents/skills/video-pipeline/engine}"
W="videos/<project>"
```

## 1. Grounding in Gate 1 Specifications (`resolved-spec.json`)

The storyboard generator directly ingests `$W/resolved-spec.json` (resolved in Gate 1) across the 6 core pillars:
- **Format & Multi-Layout:** Context-derived format (Choreographed multi-dynamic, 40/60 Split View, Screen-plus-Facecam, Corner PiP, Speaker Cutout)
- **Sounds & Music Bed:** Tactile whooshes, paper tears, clicks, ducked lofi or synth bed
- **Caption Styling:** `weight-shift` or `caption-highlight` with punch words in badge pills
- **Color Grading Preset:** Kodak Portra Warm, Hollywood Teal & Orange, Vox Documentary, Magnates Gold, etc.
- **Motion Graphics:** Researcher articles, kinetic data charts, 3D depth cards
- **Audio Processing:** Neural DeepFilterNet3 for road/car rumble, RNNoise, standard gate

Every beat in `storyboard.plan.json` must be grounded in these resolved choices.

### Collaborative Storyboard Pillars:

1. **Creative, Innovative & Trendy Multi-Layout Architecture:**
   - **Never default to a static full-screen talking head.** Actively choreograph A-roll layout transitions across narrative beats:
     - *Hook:* Full camera shot with snap punch-in (1.10x) for personal impact.
     - *Proof & Comparison Beats:* A-roll minimizes into a floating corner PiP squircle/circle, or shifts into a 40/60 split view, opening the screen for research articles, animated data charts, and 3D mockups.
     - *Core Breakdown Beats:* Speaker cutout/matte or framed card on a modern graphical, neutral dark (#0f172a, #111116), clean white, or cinematic gradient canvas.
   - **Empty Space Utilization:** Every non-full-frame beat MUST specify the visual asset occupying the opened space:
     - *Researcher Articles:* News headlines, financial journal tear-outs, and tweets with animated highlighter sweeps.
     - *Kinetic Data Charts:* Animated bar graphs, percentage growth curves, and live metric counters.
     - *3D Objects & Mockups:* Isometric depth cards, floating phone mockups, and product visuals.
2. **Visual Direction & Overlay Rules (No Cluttered Forehead Overlays):**
   - **Strict Rule:** Never place persistent top headline bands or floating checklist card pills over the creator's forehead or hairline. Floating boxes pinned to the ceiling look amateur and awkward.
   - Overlays (cards, lower thirds, callouts) must be contextual and positioned in lower safe zones (`y: 0.58 - 0.75`), side panels, or dedicated cutaways.
3. **Cuts & Pacing:**
   - Discuss cut rhythm (fast retention cuts 1.2-1.8s vs relaxed conversational pauses 2.5-4.0s).
   - Identify retakes, stumbles, and tangent lines to cut or keep.
4. **Effects & Optical Transitions:**
   - Agree on transition styles: hard cuts, light leaks, white flashes, film grain, or camera punches.
5. **References & Inspirations:**
   - Incorporate reference reels from `references/` or specific creator benchmarks from Gate 0 (`research.md`).
   - If Gate R chose a style blueprint, build the storyboard from `$W/reference-match/ROADMAP.md` (`video-reference-match`): its structure, pacing, elements and catalog style IDs, with the brand tokens filled; the grade still comes from this footage.
6. **Input Folder Inventory & Strict Raw Ingestion:**
   - **Audit the raw input folder:** Inspect `videos/<project>/raw/` and list every provided file (face camera, screen recordings, b-roll, audio, photos).
   - **Strict Adherence Boundary:** All user raw inputs must be sourced exclusively from `videos/<project>/raw/`. If the user mentions other folders or external files, only assets located within `raw/` are ingested and processed. External mentions are treated as advisory context only.
   - **Suggest recording more content:** If the speaker mentions a product, screen demo, website, or action that lacks footage, actively suggest:
     > *"You discuss [X] at [timestamp]. We don't have b-roll for it in the raw input folder. Would you like to record a quick 5-10 second b-roll / screen capture of [X] and drop it into raw/? It will make this moment significantly more compelling! Otherwise, we can design an animated graphic card or generate an image."*
7. **Generative Assets vs HyperFrames Animations:**
   - Discuss whether AI stills (Gemini Flash), AI video inserts (Veo), or HyperFrames/Remotion programmatic animations are needed.
8. **Color Grading Intent & Preview:**
   - Run `python3 "$ENG/scripts/grade.py" preview --input "$W/raw/<clip>" --out "$W/grade-preview.jpg"` to generate a side-by-side comparison sheet.
   - Present the 6 curated presets (`commercial-clean`, `cinematic-warm`, `modern-tech`, `moody-film`, `vibrant-pop`, `neutral-correct`) and agree on the look.
9. **Autonomous Caption Styling (Zero User Burden):**
   - The user does not need to specify caption styles. The editor autonomously pairs the optimal caption flow (`focus-blur-resolve` + badged punch pills + kinetic accent punches) to match the chosen format and energy level.

## 2. Complete Storyboard Matrix (Per-Beat Specification)

Every beat in `plan.md` and `storyboard.plan.json` must define 5 architectural pillars:

### A. Video Effects (VFX) & Transitions
Specify the optical treatment for transitions and overlays:
- **Optical Flashes:** `flash-through-white` (hold 2 frames, decay 0.18s), `light-leak-warm`, `lens-flare-anamorphic`.
- **Atmospheric FX:** Film grain overlay (8-12% opacity, fine 35mm), vignette edge falloff (15-20% black curve).
- **Surface & Texture:** Glassmorphism frosted backdrops (`backdrop-filter: blur(16px)`, border: 1.5px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.15)), paper tear edges, glow drop-shadows.

### B. Color Grading & Lighting Intent
Set the mood and color palette per scene:
- **Grade Style:** Calibrated preset from `grade.py` (e.g. `commercial-clean`, `cinematic-warm`, `modern-tech`).
- **Contrast & Exposure:** Contrast ratio 1.15, highlights restrained, warm skin-tone protection, shadows crushed for depth.

### C. Exact Typography & Font Hierarchy
No generic fonts. Explicitly specify font families, weights, sizing, and stroke parameters:
- **Punch Font (Power Keywords):** `Poppins Black (900)` or `Anton Display`, All-Caps, size 72-84px, letter-spacing -0.02em, text-stroke: 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.92).
- **Display Accent Font (Curiosity/Elegance):** `Syne Bold (800)` or `Playfair Bold Italic (700)`.
- **Supporting / Body Font:** `Inter Bold (700)` or `Poppins Medium (500)`, size 48-56px.
- **Micro / Subtext:** Size 32-38px, uppercase, letter-spacing +0.05em, opacity 0.85.

### D. Kinetics, Dynamics & Motion Physics
Specify exact movement curves, physics parameters, and timing behaviors:
- **Physics Engine Standard:** Damped harmonic motion (`damping: 14 - 18`, `stiffness: 160 - 200`, `mass: 1.0`).
- **Easing Curve:** `power3.out` for snappy entrances, `back.out(1.3)` for subtle scale-overshoot, `power2.in` for fast exits. Never use cartoonish high-bounce curves.
- **Scale Dynamics:** Micro scale pop (`scale: 0.90` -> `1.06` -> `1.00` in 0.18s) with physical momentum.
- **Tilt Physics:** Micro-rotation (`-2.0deg` to `+2.0deg`) on entrance settling to `0deg`.
- **Stagger Physics:** Multi-item cards enter with an 80ms cascade delay (`stagger: 0.08s`), moving upward with decelerating inertia (`y: 35px` -> `0px`).
- **Camera Punch Dynamics:** 1.08x - 1.12x scale zoom snapped in 0.12s on key trigger syllables.

### E. HyperFrames Catalog Foundation
- Query and install verified blocks: `npx hyperframes catalog --query "<treatment>"` and `npx hyperframes add <component>`.
